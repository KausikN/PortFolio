<h2>I'm Kausik</h2>
<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
<hr>
CS Undergrad, Web developer

<p>
  I was born, brought up, studied and basically did everything i did in my life here in <b><i>Chennai</i></b>.
  I studied in Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School from 1st all the way through 12th standard. In my 11th and 12th days, i developed a 
  huge interest in coding and i was adamant that i would only pursue <i>Computer Science</i> in college. Fortunately for me, i got a      `   sufficient rank in JEE Mains to get into <b>IIITDM Kancheepuram</b>.</p>
  
<p>
  I'm now trying my best to introduce myself and become an expert in various CS topics, languages, etc. Currently Iâ€™m working as a Web       Developer at <a href="https://github.com/DMT-IIIT">Digital Media Team, IIITDM Kancheepuram</a>.
